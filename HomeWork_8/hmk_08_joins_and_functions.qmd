```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(nycflights13)
glimpse(flights)
```


# Joins

1. Imagine youâ€™ve found the top 10 most popular destinations using this code:
```{r}
top_dest <- flights |>
  count(dest, sort = TRUE) |>
  head(10)
glimpse(top_dest)
```
How can you find all flights to those destinations?
ANSWER :here we can do this using join function
```{r}
select_all_top_dest <- top_dest |>
  inner_join(flights, by= "dest") |>
  select(-n)
glimpse(select_all_top_dest)
```

2. Write a function to 'rescale' a numeric vector by subtracting the mean of the vector from each element and then dividing each element by the standard deviation.
```{r}

rescale_numeric_vector <- function(numeric_vector) {
  mean_value <- mean(numeric_vector)
  std_deveation <- sd(numeric_vector)
  output_vector <- (numeric_vector - mean_value) / std_deveation
  
  return(output_vector)
}

# example:
rescale_numeric_vector(c(1,2,3,4,5))
```
