#### What's wrong with this one?
Without a doubt, it's difficult to display multiple curves simultaneously and ensure that the individual curves may be seen. Colors would be nice, but if color is not allowed, four different line types (solid, dashed, dotted, dash-dotted) might work.

#### What should have been done?
Figure 1D could have been discarded completely, and the whole figure shouldn't take up more than half a page.
